# Introduction 

I have merged Kpodar's dataset with the Remitscope dataset. The following sections present visualizations that highlight the results of this combined analysis.

- To the best of my knowledge, this is currently the most accurate and complete dataset available. 
- The next possible step would be to directly access remittance datasets from individual central banks. It may also be worthwhile to focus on specific countries, such as Georgia or the Philippines, as they are significant outliers in terms of the volume of remittance data published. 

- Other academic papers suggest that additional remittance data may be available for countries such as Italy and Tonga. For Italy, see the [Bank of Italy Remittance Dataset (Excel)](https://github.com/WilliamClintC/RER/blob/main/data/Remittance_4/Bank%20of%20Italy%20Dataset.xlsx) (not part of our main dataset).

- Based on Dean Yang's work, detailed information on remittances for the Philippines can be found from surveyors, central banks, and remittance providers.

- We also found a [South Asia Remittance Dataset (Harvard Dataverse)](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=10224832&version=1.0). This dataset was compiled by [Professor Mustafizur Rahman](https://cpd.org.bd/distinguished-fellows/professor-mustafizur-rahman/). While I am not familiar with this institution, the data is reported to originate from the central bank. I would appreciate your thoughts on whether we should consider merging this dataset with ours. The associated dataset link in our repository is available here: [South Asia Dataset (Excel)](https://github.com/WilliamClintC/RER/blob/main/data/Remittance_4/South%20Asia%20Dataset.xlsx).

I have sent out emails to Dean Yang (general/Philippine remittance), Mustafizur Rahman (South Asian remittance), Giulia Bettin (Italy remittance), and Huidan Lin (Tonga).

**Data Collection Insights:**

Most central banks provide remittance data for the most recent years. For example, if data is collected in 2024, the available range is typically 2019–2024. If collected in 2018, the range would be 2014–2018. This pattern is consistent across most sources I have reviewed.

**Remittance Data Construction:**


Additionally, the Kpodar dataset provides a more detailed disaggregation of remittances by these metrics. I mention it here for reference, in case it may be of interest for further analysis.

> Total remittances received should be calculated as the sum of personal transfers (`personalcr_usd`) and compensation of employees (`compcr_usd`). For countries lacking personal transfer data, workers' remittances (`workcr_usd`) can be used as a substitute. In the corridor data, remittances are already aggregated.



# Data Update

I have contacted the authors from [Defying the Odds: Remittances During the COVID-19 Pandemic](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2021/07/16/Defying-the-Odds-Remittances-During-the-COVID-19-Pandemic-461321)

 - The Remitscope data is reliable but incomplete
 - [Defying the Odds: Remittances During the COVID-19 Pandemic](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2021/07/16/Defying-the-Odds-Remittances-During-the-COVID-19-Pandemic-461321) provides additional data to the Remitscope data. 


The complete merged dataset is available here: [Code/14.csv](https://github.com/WilliamClintC/RER/blob/main/Code/14.csv)

# Data Analysis Results

## Overview
This analysis examines remittance flows using data extracted from Remitscope, and shows how the Remitscope dataset changes upon the addition of Kpodar's data.



### Data Completeness Summary

**Data Completeness Summary**

- **Total records**: 728 → 3980
- **Date range**: 2019–2024 → 2018–2024
- **Sending countries**: 206 → 257
- **Receiving countries**: 20 (10.3% of world) → 214

## Sending Countries Analysis

The remittance data shows a global distribution of sending countries, with developed nations dominating the top positions:

## Temporal Distribution

The data collection shows significant variation across years:

### Records by Year

**Note**: 2023 data is completely missing from the dataset.

The dataset distribution by year after including Kpodar's data is shown below:

![Data Distribution by Year (Merged Dataset)](images/12.png)

![Data Distribution by Year (Merged Dataset - Africa & Latin America)](images/18.png)

## Key Findings

- Kpodar's dataset is significantly larger than the Remitscope dataset. Though this is attributed mainly to two countries, Georgia and the Philippines, more details are shown below.
- Once we limit the dataset to African and Latin American countries, the dataset is more reasonable. 
- **Peak Collection**: 2022 shows the highest data collection with 408 records.

The cross-tabulation heatmap below shows that Georgia and the Philippines dominate the observations. This is likely due to the extensive information provided by their central banks.

### Receiving Countries Analysis

The receiving countries exhibit a strong concentration in Latin America, with Ecuador (183 records) and Mexico (169 records) leading the original dataset.

## Data Concentration

We investigate whether there is an even distribution of countries by counting the top 10 countries with the most observations and comparing them to total observations.
