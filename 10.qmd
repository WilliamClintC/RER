abstract: This document is a follow-up to the meeting on September 29th and addresses the items discussed during that meeting. This provides an update on who was contacted regarding the remittance datasets, offers updates on previously problematic pdf file links, and clarifies how the stablecoin/bitcoin cross-border flows dataset works. Most importantly, this presents the extracted remittance data from Remitscope.

# Data Update

 - I have contacted two authors from [Defying the Odds: Remittances During the COVID-19 Pandemic](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2021/07/16/Defying-the-Odds-Remittances-During-the-COVID-19-Pandemic-461321)
 - The Remitscope data is reliable but incomplete
 - [Defying the Odds: Remittances During the COVID-19 Pandemic](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2021/07/16/Defying-the-Odds-Remittances-During-the-COVID-19-Pandemic-461321) provides additional data to the Remitscope data. 
 - I am currently requesting acces to their dataset so that we can merge their dataset (2018-2020) to ours (2019-2024)
