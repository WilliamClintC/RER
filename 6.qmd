# Introduction

Remittance datasets are generally limited in scope and quality. This report presents the best available datasets and summarizes key literature on remittance measurement. Most research focuses on the effects of remittances rather than forecasting flows. There are two main types of datasets: cost of remittances (detailed, corridor-level) and actual remittance flows (often less accurate and updated infrequently). The World Bank provides the primary source for both, with most other datasets derived from their data. Remitscope is also worth mentioning as a potential dataset, given its completeness. More details can be found in the [Remitscope section](#remitscope). 



# Best Dataset: World Bank

## Cost of Remittances Dataset

This is a more comprehensive dataset. Please see the [sample dataset](https://github.com/WilliamClintC/RER/blob/main/data/Remittance_2/rpw_dataset_2011_2024_q3.xlsx) where we can observe source and destination countries.

We can also observe the firm, payment instrument (bank transfer, cash, etc.), and speed.

There are many different methodologies with regards to remittances. For an overview, please see the [World Bank's resources page](https://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/resources).

The World Bank aims to establish _unified standards and maintain public data availability_. See [certified national and regional databases](https://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/national-and-regional-databases-certified-by-the-world-bank). There are issues with their data request site; I have submitted several requests without receiving instructions. The dataset should be available at: [World Bank Remittance Prices Dataset](https://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/file-download/remittance-prices-worldwide-2011-2024q3-dataset).

## Remittances Sent Dataset

The following fields are available:

![Available Fields for Remittances Sent Dataset](images/Screenshot%202025-08-07%20063601.png)

Bilateral remittance flows are not directly observable; only aggregate data is available. The corridor-level dataset is released infrequently. According to the literature:

> Additionally, the World Bank also publishes estimates on bilateral remittance flows. The basis for bilateral remittances estimates are weighted migrant stock data, the weighted income of migrants based on the per capita income in the country of destination, and the weighted income in the origin country of the migrant (Ratha and Shaw, 2007: 43).

The main dataset is available at: [World Bank Development Indicators - Personal Remittances](https://databank.worldbank.org/metadataglossary/world-development-indicators/series/BM.TRF.PWKR.CD.DT). See limitations at the [metadata page](https://databank.worldbank.org/metadataglossary/world-development-indicators/series/BM.TRF.PWKR.CD.DT).

> Because direct measurement (tracking actual transactions) is often incomplete, they use a mix of methods: direct reporting when possible and estimates/models to fill in gaps.

## Remitscope

Consider [RemitScope](https://remitscope.org/latin-america/themes/) as an additional resource. See the [guide](https://remitscope.org/how-to-use-remitscope/) for usage. RemitScope aggregates data from various sources, including bilateral flows, but these are not always easily accessible.

> RemitSCOPE brings together data from secondary sources, that are usually scattered in different organisations and agencies, as well as collecting data through primary research and directly from market operators and regulators.

Currently, RemitScope covers Africa and Latin America. Asia is coming soon.

RemitScope provides visualization tools; data scraping may be required for analysis.

## Canadian International Development Platform: CIDP

The [CIDP Remittances Explorer](https://cidpnsi.ca/remittances-explorer/) uses World Bank datasets to create interactive remittance data visualizations. The dataset is available for download from the project repository: [CIDP Remittances Data](https://github.com/WilliamClintC/RER/blob/main/data/Remittance_2/CIDP.csv)

## Data Request Status

## World Bank
I have submitted a data request through the [World Bank's data download portal](https://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/data-download) for the most current and comprehensive remittance datasets.



## Wise & Remitly

I contacted Remitly and Wise to request data access. Wise denied our request:
