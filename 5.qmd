# Introduction

Overall, there are now improved methods for measuring remittances compared to older approaches such as population inference. However, obtaining accurate data on remittances remains a significant challenge. To better understand how remittances are measured, a good starting point is [High Priority](#high-priority)
 which is from the World Bank Group. Another useful resource is [Medium-High Priority](#medium-high-priority), provided by the United Nations Capital Development Fund. The main challenges in remittance measurement include defining what constitutes a remittance and distinguishing between different measurement approaches, such as macro-level and micro-level methods. Although measurement techniques have become more accurate, considerable errors and uncertainties persist. For further discussion on measurement reliability, see [Arcangelo et al., 2023](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pAtaJZZPiYqQxYHhQaiGtDIG2D1GC0vw/view?usp=sharing).

# Wise (TransferWise) Business Model

Wise is a fintech company that facilitates **low-cost, international money transfers**. It operates on a unique peer-to-peer model.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Core Business Model

### 1. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Currency Matching

Wise avoids moving money across borders by matching users sending in opposite directions: - E.g., If someone sends CAD to the UK and another sends GBP to Canada, Wise matches them. - Money stays within local banking systems, reducing fees and increasing speed.

### 2. Revenue from Transfer Fees

Wise charges: - **Fixed fee** per transaction. - **Variable fee** (percentage of the amount sent).

*Example:* A \$1,000 USD transfer to the UK might cost only \$5â€“7, compared to \$40+ via a bank.

# Dataset on remitances

## Problem (William's Notes) Challenges and Methods in Measuring Remittance Transactions

### Low Quality of Data

-   Statistical remittance data are often unreliable or incomplete.

### Nature of Remittances

-   **Heterogeneous**: Numerous small transactions carried out by individuals.
-   **Multiple Channels**:
    -   **Formal**: e.g., electronic wire transfers.
    -   **Informal**: e.g., hand-carried cash or goods across borders.

### Detection and Reporting Issues

-   **Small transaction sizes** often evade standard data collection systems.
-   **Informal transactions** are typically underreported or excluded from balance of payments (BoP) data.

## Measurement Approaches

### Direct Measurement

-   Includes **transaction reporting** and **surveys**.
-   Considered ideal when feasible.

### Combined Methods

-   Some countries use a **hybrid approach**:
    -   Combine **direct measurement** with **estimates** where data are lacking.

### Model-Based Approaches

-   Models are used to:
    -   **Fill data gaps**.
    -   **Estimate global totals**.
-   The **accuracy** of these models depends on the **reliability of input data**.

### Assumptions and Limitations

-   **Indirect data** require **assumptions** to convert into remittance figures.
-   Assumptions must be **plausible**, but are often **untestable or unverifiable in practice**.

## Observed Datasets

-   [SDGs Today Remittance](https://sdgstoday.org/dataset/remittances?)
-   [World Bank Remittance](https://databank.worldbank.org/metadataglossary/world-development-indicators/series/BM.TRF.PWKR.CD.DT?)

## Literature

### Takeaway

#### Summary: Challenges and Improvements in Remittance Data Collection

##### Key Challenges

-   **Poor data quality**: Despite increased interest, statistics on remittances are still inconsistent and incomplete.
-   **Global discrepancies**: In 2023, reported outward flows were only two-thirds of reported inward flows, highlighting growing asymmetries.
-   **Informal channels**: A significant share of remittances is sent through informal means (e.g., hand-carried cash), which often goes untracked.
-   **Inconsistent methods**: Countries use different concepts, definitions, and recording practices, leading to classification errors.
-   **Impact of digitalization**: The rise of digital platforms, especially post-COVID, has reshaped remittance flows, but existing measurement tools lag behind.

##### Ongoing Initiatives

-   **RemitStat (World Bank)** [RemitStat](https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/peoplemove/improving-data-on-remittances--remitstat) : A global initiative involving 46 countries, Eurostat, and the IMF, aiming to improve remittance data.
-   **TT-GA (IMF Task Team on Global Asymmetries)** [Preliminary Report](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2024/pdf/44/BOPCOM%2024-08%20-%20Report%20of%20the%20Task%20Team%20on%20Global%20Asymmetries%20%20Progress%20and%20Work%20Plan%20for%202025.pdf) : Established in October 2023 to investigate data gaps, legal and methodological barriers, and propose solutions.
