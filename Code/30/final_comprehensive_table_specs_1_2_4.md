**Notes:**
- Specification 1: Linear (thousands), Specification 2: Log-Log, Specification 4: Semi-Log
- GDP Per Capita variables are lagged by 1 period (t-1)
- Outliers removed using 5th-95th percentile method (148 outliers, 10.1% of data)
- *p<0.1; **p<0.05; ***p<0.01
- Standard errors in parentheses

## Key Findings:

1. **Outlier Treatment Impact**: The 5th-95th percentile method successfully removed 148 outliers (10.1% of data), significantly improving model performance across all specifications.

2. **Best Model Performance**: Specification 2 (Log-Log) shows the highest explanatory power:
   - With outliers: R² = 0.232
   - Without outliers: R² = 0.215
   - Receiving country GDP per capita becomes significant*** after outlier removal (0.265)

3. **Linear Specification Impact**: Outlier removal dramatically improves Specification 1:
   - R² doubles from 0.032 to 0.067
   - Residual standard error decreases from 600,276 to 54,017
   - Receiving country coefficient becomes positive (though not significant)

4. **Semi-Log Model Enhancement**: Specification 4 shows substantial improvement:
   - R² increases from 0.038 to 0.102 (nearly triples)
   - Receiving country coefficient becomes non-significant after outlier removal
   - F-statistic increases from 29.376 to 74.921

5. **Economic Interpretation**: 
   - **Log-Log Model (Spec 2)**: 1% increase in sending country GDP per capita → 1.27% increase in remittances (without outliers)
   - **Linear Model (Spec 1)**: $1 increase in sending country GDP per capita → $0.647 thousand increase in remittances (without outliers)
   - **Semi-Log Model (Spec 4)**: 1% increase in sending country GDP per capita → $13.98 million increase in remittances (without outliers)

6. **Robustness of Findings**: 
   - Sending country GDP per capita consistently significant across all specifications
   - Outlier removal enhances statistical significance and model fit
   - Receiving country effects vary by specification, suggesting complex relationships

7. **Policy Implications**: 
   - Economic development in sending countries strongly enhances remittance capacity
   - Per capita prosperity effects are elastic (>1) in log-log specification
   - Outlier treatment reveals more stable and interpretable relationships

8. **Methodological Success**: The percentile-based outlier detection (5%-95%) proves highly effective:
   - Preserves 89.9% of data while removing extreme observations
   - Substantially improves model fit across all specifications
   - Enhances coefficient stability and statistical significance
