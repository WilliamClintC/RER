COEFFICIENT INTERPRETATION:
---------------------------

SPECIFICATION 1 (Linear Model):
Without Outliers Results:
- Sending GDP per capita coefficient: 0.647*** (t-stat ≈ 9.7)
- Interpretation: $1,000 increase in sending country GDP per capita → $647 increase in remittances
- Economic significance: Strong positive relationship, statistically robust
- Policy relevance: Direct dollar-for-dollar impact calculation

SPECIFICATION 2 (Log-Log Model):
Without Outliers Results:
- Sending GDP per capita elasticity: 1.268*** (t-stat ≈ 18.9)
- Receiving GDP per capita elasticity: 0.265*** (t-stat ≈ 2.8)
- Interpretation: 1% increase in sending GDP per capita → 1.27% increase in remittances
- Economic significance: Elastic relationship, both countries matter
- Policy relevance: Percentage-based policy impact assessment

SPECIFICATION 4 (Semi-Log Model):
Without Outliers Results:
- Sending GDP per capita coefficient: 13.981*** (t-stat ≈ 12.2)
- Interpretation: 1% increase in sending GDP per capita → $14 million increase in remittances
- Economic significance: Large absolute impact, but depends on base level
- Policy relevance: Useful for aggregate flow projections

OUTLIER TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS:
--------------------------------

Most Improved Model: Specification 1
- R² improvement: +109% (0.032 → 0.067)
- Residual SE improvement: -91% (600,276 → 54,017)
- Coefficient stability: Dramatically improved (0.647 vs 4.734)

Best Overall Model: Specification 2
- Highest R² even with outliers (0.232)
- Maintains strong performance without outliers (0.215)
- Both variables significant in robust specification
- Standard elasticity interpretation

Largest Coefficient Change: Specification 4
- Sending coefficient: 85.960 → 13.981 (84% reduction)
- More realistic and interpretable results after outlier removal

STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE PATTERNS:
----------------------------------

Sending Country GDP Per Capita:
- Always significant*** across all specifications and outlier treatments
- Most stable coefficient across different model forms
- Core driver of remittance flows

Receiving Country GDP Per Capita:
- Specification 1: Not significant in either treatment
- Specification 2: Becomes significant*** after outlier removal
- Specification 4: Significant** with outliers, not significant without
- More sensitive to outlier treatment and model specification

MODEL SELECTION CRITERIA:
-------------------------

For Academic Research:
- Primary: Specification 2 (Log-Log) without outliers
- Reason: Standard in literature, clear elasticity interpretation, robust results

For Policy Analysis:
- Primary: Specification 1 (Linear) without outliers  
- Reason: Direct USD impact, easy communication to policymakers

For Forecasting:
- Primary: Specification 2 (Log-Log) without outliers
- Reason: Highest explanatory power, stable coefficients

For International Comparisons:
- Primary: Specification 2 (Log-Log) without outliers
- Reason: Elasticities comparable across countries of different sizes

ROBUSTNESS ASSESSMENT:
----------------------

High Robustness (Consistent across specifications):
- Sending country GDP per capita always positive and significant***
- Economic development in origin countries enhances remittance capacity
- Lagged variables effectively address endogeneity concerns

Medium Robustness (Varies by specification):
- Receiving country GDP per capita effects
- Magnitude of sending country effects
- Overall model fit (R²)

Low Robustness (Sensitive to outliers):
- Absolute coefficient magnitudes
- Residual standard errors
- Some significance levels

FINAL TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
================================

1. PREFERRED SPECIFICATION: 
   Log-Log model (Spec 2) without outliers for primary analysis

2. ROBUSTNESS CHECK: 
   Linear model (Spec 1) without outliers for sensitivity analysis

3. OUTLIER TREATMENT: 
   5th-95th percentile method essential for reliable inference

4. REPORTING STRATEGY:
   - Report all three specifications for completeness
   - Emphasize log-log results for main conclusions
   - Highlight outlier treatment impact in methodology section

5. POLICY COMMUNICATION:
   - Use linear model results for concrete USD impact estimates
   - Use log-log model results for percentage-based policy scenarios
   - Always base recommendations on outlier-adjusted results
