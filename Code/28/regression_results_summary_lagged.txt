Standard errors in parentheses
GDP variables are lagged by 1 period (t-1)

KEY FINDINGS:
=============
1. Using lagged GDP variables reduces sample size from ~2,837 to 1,467 observations
   due to the need for prior period data.

2. Specification 2 (Log-Log) shows the highest explanatory power (R² = 0.410) with both
   lagged sending and receiving country GDP being highly significant.

3. In the linear specification (Spec 1), lagged sending country GDP is highly significant
   but receiving country GDP is not significant.

4. The lagged approach helps address potential endogeneity concerns by using prior
   period economic conditions to predict current remittances.

5. Results are identical for "with outliers" and "without outliers" models, suggesting
   the outlier removal procedure didn't significantly affect this particular dataset.
