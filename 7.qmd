## William's Observations

An interesting pattern emerges from this data: Germany is the only high-income country among the top 10 receiving countries, while simultaneously being among the top sending countries (ranked 6th in sending and 9th in receiving). This dual position is interesting. From my understanding, this occurs because Germany is bordered by significantly wealthier countries with higher GDP per capita, such as Luxembourg and Switzerland.


## Visual Analysis

The following figures provide additional insights into remittance:

### Figure 1: Remittances Received vs GDP

![Remittances Received vs GDP](images/Screenshot 2025-08-21 070908.png)

This relationship follows expected patterns, showing a positive correlation between GDP and total remittances received.

### Figure 2: Remittances as Percentage of GDP Over Time

![Remittances as Percentage of GDP](images/Screenshot 2025-08-21 070932.png)

Remittances as a percentage of GDP have been slightly increasing over time.

### Figure 3: Global Remittance Flows - Sending Countries

The United States is disproportionately large in the amount of remittances it sends compared to other countries.

### Figure 4: Remittances Sent as Percentage of GDP

![Remittances Sent as Percentage of GDP](images/Screenshot 2025-08-21 071747.png)

Gulf countries and Canada are notable outliers in terms of the percentage of GDP sent as remittances, reflecting their significant migrant worker populations.

### Figure 5: Additional Remittance Analysis

Both of these figures confirm the patterns observed in previous graphs, reinforcing our findings about global remittance flows.

## Takeaway


1. **Dominance of High-Income Sending Countries**: The United States leads significantly in total remittances sent, followed by Gulf countries (Saudi Arabia, UAE) and other developed nations.

2. **Developing Countries as Primary Recipients**: India, China and Philippines dominate as receiving countries.

3. **Germany's Unique Position**: Germany's presence in both top sending and receiving lists.
